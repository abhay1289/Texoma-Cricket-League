Update all images across the Texoma Cricket League website to match the regional/national level cricket league theme in Texas, USA. Images should depict:

- A modern outdoor multi-sport complex with proper cricket facilities (NOT international stadium level)
- Professional-grade players in proper team jerseys/kits with full cricket gear
- Community-focused atmosphere with 100-300 spectators
- Natural daylight, outdoor feel
- Clean, professional event photography style
- Regional/inter-city tournament level feel
