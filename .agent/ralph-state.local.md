Update all images across the Texoma Cricket League website to reflect a regional/national level cricket league in Texas, USA. Images should show:
- Modern outdoor cricket complex (like Prairie View Cricket Complex)
- Multiple proper cricket ovals/grounds with professional turf pitches
- Adult players in proper team jerseys with full cricket gear
- 100-300 spectators, community atmosphere
- Natural daylight, afternoon sun
- NOT international/World Cup level, NOT massive stadiums
