About Texoma Cricket League
Texoma Cricket League (TCL) is a premier national youth cricket tournament platform built on global standards, delivering a world-class youth cricket experience in the United States.
Built around the belief that young cricketers deserve professional competition and clear pathways, TCL brings together teams from across the country to compete in well-organized, high-quality tournaments that reward preparation, skill, and sportsmanship. Our events are designed not just to determine winners, but to help players grow, teams progress, and families enjoy a true championship experience.
At the heart of TCL is Sports Texoma, our home venue in Texoma. By anchoring our national championships at a centralized, purpose-built facility, we ensure consistency in playing conditions, operations, and overall tournament quality—something that has long been missing in youth cricket across the U.S.
TCL operates on a national tournament pathway model, with regional events and qualifiers leading to flagship championships at Sports Texoma. This structure gives academies and teams a clear objective, meaningful competition, and a reason to return year after year.
We are committed to:
	•	High standards of competition and officiating
	•	Player development alongside competitive excellence
	•	Fair play, integrity, and respect on and off the field
	•	A player-first, family-friendly tournament environment
Texoma Cricket League is not a local league that happens to host tournaments. It is a national platform built to unify youth cricket communities, showcase emerging talent, and establish Sports Texoma as the home of America’s premier youth cricket championships.
As we continue to grow, TCL aims to become the trusted destination for academies, coaches, players, and families seeking meaningful competition, professional execution, and a clear national stage.
Sports Texoma is a regional sports complex platform rooted in the Texoma Region, spanning communities across Texas and Oklahoma.

We exist to:
	•	Create inclusive, competitive sporting opportunities
	•	Support local teams and leagues
	•	Amplify underrepresented sports
	•	Build regional pride through athletics
